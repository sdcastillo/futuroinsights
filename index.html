<h2>Review of Grok3 and DeepSeek</h2>
<p>Grok 3 has been making waves in the AI community, with some claiming it outperforms ChatGPT in key areas. However, OpenAI, backed by significant funding, is expected to make major improvements with GPT-5, ensuring its dominance in the field. Meanwhile, DeepSeek stunned the AI world by delivering an exceptional chatbot despite having significantly fewer resources, proving that innovation is not just about funding but also about strategy and execution.</p>

<h2>Review of the o1 and Advanced Reasoning Mode</h2>
<p>The latest o1 update introduces a new level of reasoning capability, making it far superior to its predecessors. With enhanced contextual awareness and improved decision-making, o1 can tackle complex problems with greater accuracy. This marks a significant step forward in AI evolution, pushing the boundaries of what chatbots can achieve.</p>
<h3>Review of the New Chat GPT-4 Omni - First Impressions - May 2024</h3> 
       
       The new AI Chat GPT-4 Omni is more human-like and faster, but it is not AGI and has limitations in its abilities, particularly in legal recommendations, and it is important to consult with a qualified attorney for compliance with state laws and unique circumstances.
ü§ñ Chat GPT-4 Omni feels more human-like and is faster, but it's not AGI, just a specialized language model.
       
       Open AI made a huge update to their chat, but and although it was already quite effective now it feels even more emotional like I‚Äôm texting a friend.  

This clip shows me using an API for chat GPt4(o) that is called FreedomGPT which is a project to make LLMs available to all.  The Open AI that I use for chat GPT has model selection for 3.5, 4, and 4(O) though you max out the request limit.   Using 3.5 for basic tasks because this is efficient.

The response times have been delayed. You can ask it more open-ended questions and still get good answers. Although I would say it still suffers from the formatting issues. It will give you more information than you need it to as in this example, when I asked it to fill in a few sentences, it returned an entire document is still the same that we humans face which is how do you effectively select the information that‚Äôs important.  Google has also released many AI products
    </p>
    <h3>Conversational AI with Documents</h3>

    The use of machine learning and regression models can accurately predict bike sharing demand, and that AI can be trained to understand and use these models effectively.
Chat with a document on AWS Bedrock to summarize a complex 18-page technical piece of writing.  You can find this document from my earlier video about the project.
üìù
The document examines data on bike sharing demand and explores modeling approaches to predict the number of bike rentals per hour, evaluating various regression models and identifying key factors influencing demand.

<h3>AI Foundation Models - June 2024</h3>

Are these reliable & Secure Generative AI?  

Amazon Bedrock is a new service for building Foundation models, offering easy scaling and customization for generative AI applications, with a focus on reliable and secure results through customization and guardrails.

- Amazon Bedrock is a new service for building Foundation models, offering easy scaling and customization for generative AI applications. 

- AWS Bedrock allows customization and selection of state-of-the-art AI models for reliable and secure generative AI.

AI used to generate a poem about traveling to Vermont, discussing data set creation and increasing response length. 

- Amazon's Titan text model generates varied responses to short prompts, with the second poem being less rigid and following a specific structure. 

- Generative AI applications require consistent parameters for reliable and secure results.

- AI system uses guardrails to filter inappropriate content and prevent users from overriding it by adding denied topics and avoiding misclassification. 

- Filter and block profanity and sensitive information in AI model responses, including alcohol-related words and personal identifiable information.

Foundation models in AI can be accessed through Amazon's platform for transfer learning, allowing for exploration of different parameters and tunings.
