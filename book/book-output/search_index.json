The syllabus uses fancy language to describe the topics covered on the exam, making it sound more difficult than it should be. A good analogy is a job description that has many complex-sounding tasks, when in reality the day-to-day operations of the employee are far simpler. https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/edu/2019/2019-12-exam-pa-syllabus.pdf A non-technical translation is as follows: Writing in Microsoft Word (30-40%) Write in professional language Type more than 50 words-per-minute Manipulating Data in R (15-25%) Quickly clean data sets Find data errors planted by the SOA Perform queries (aggregations, summaries, transformations) Making decisions based on machine learning and statistics knowledge (40-50%) Understand several algorithms from a high level and be able to interpret and explain results in english Read R documentation about models and use this to make decisions "],
["preface-what-is-machine-learning.html", "Chapter 3 Preface - What is Machine Learning?", " Chapter 3 Preface - What is Machine Learning? All of use are already familiar with how to learn - by learning from our mistakes. By repeating what is successful and avoiding what results in failure, we learn by doing, by experience, or trial-and-error. Some study methods work well, but other methods do not. We all know that memorizing answers without understanding concepts is an ineffective method, and that doing many practice problems is better than doing only a few. These ideas apply to how computers learn as much as they do to how humans learn. Take the example of preparing for an actuarial exam. We can clearly state our objective: get as many correct answers as possible! We want to correctly predict the solution to every problem. Said another way, we are trying to minimize the error, the percentage of incorrect problems. Later on, we will see how choosing the objective function changes how models are fit. The “data” are the practice problems, and the “label” is the answer (A,B,C,D,E). We want to build a “mental model” that reads the question and predicts the answer. The SOA suggests 100 hours per hour of exam, which means that actuaries train on hundreds of problems before the real exam. We don’t have access to the questions that will be on the exam ahead of time, and so this represents “validation” or “holdout” data. In the chapter on cross-validation, we will see how computers use hold-out sets to test model performance. The more practice problems that we do, the larger the training data set, and the better our “mental model” becomes. When we see new problems, ones which have not appeared in the practice exams, we often have a difficult time. Problems which we have seen before are easier, and we have more confidence in our answers. Statistics tells us that as the sample size increases, model performance tends to increase. More difficult concepts tend to require more practice, and more complex machine learning problems require more data. We typically save time by only doing odd-numbered problems. This insures that we still get the same proportion of each type of question while doing fewer problems. If we are unsure of a question, we will often seek a second opinion, or ask an online forum for help. Later on, we will see how “down-sampling”, “bagging”, and “boosting” are all similar concepts.

["getting-started.html", "Chapter 4 Getting started 4.1 Download ISLR 4.2 Installing R 4.3 Installing RStudio 4.4 Set the R library 4.5 Download the data", " Chapter 4 Getting started This book is designed to get you set up within an hour. If this is your first time using R, then you will need to install two pieces of software, R and RStudio. Once these four steps have been done you should not need to download anything else needed for this book. You will be able to work offline. 4.1 Download ISLR This book references the publically-avialable textbook “An Introduction to Statistical Learning”, which can be downloaded for free http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ 4.2 Installing R This is the engine that runs the code. https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html 4.3 Installing RStudio This is the tool that helps you to write the code. Just as MS Word creates documents, RStudio creates R scripts and other documents. Download RStudio Desktop (the free edition) and choose a place on your computer to install it. https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 4.4 Set the R library R code is organized into libraries. You want to use the exact same code that will be on the Prometric Computers. This requires installing older versions of libraries. Change your R library to the one which was included within the SOA’s modules. #.libPaths(&quot;PATH_TO_SOAS_LIBRARY/PAlibrary&quot;) 4.5 Download the data For your convenience, all data in this book, including data from prior exams and sample solutions, has been put into a library called ExamPAData by the author. To access, simplly run the below lines of code to download this data. #check if devtools is installed and then install ExamPAData from github if(&quot;devtools&quot; %in% installed.packages()){ library(devtools) install_github(&quot;https://github.com/sdcastillo/ExamPAData&quot;) } else{ install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) install_github(&quot;https://github.com/sdcastillo/ExamPAData&quot;) } Once this has run, you can access the data using library(ExamPAData). To check that this is installed correctly see if the insurance data set has loaded. If this returns “object not found”, then the library was not installed. library(ExamPAData) summary(insurance) ## district group age holders ## Min. :1.00 Length:64 Length:64 Min. : 3.00 ## 1st Qu.:1.75 Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.: 46.75 ## Median :2.50 Mode :character Mode :character Median : 136.00 ## Mean :2.50 Mean : 364.98 ## 3rd Qu.:3.25 3rd Qu.: 327.50 ## Max. :4.00 Max. :3582.00 ## claims ## Min. : 0.00 ## 1st Qu.: 9.50 ## Median : 22.00 ## Mean : 49.23 ## 3rd Qu.: 55.50 ## Max. :400.00 "],
["r-programming.html", "Chapter 5 R programming 5.1 Notebook chunks 5.2 Basic operations 5.3 Lists 5.4 Functions 5.5 Data frames 5.6 Pipes", " Chapter 5 R programming There are already many great R tutorials available. To save time, this book will cover the absolute essentials. The book “R for Data Science” provides one such introduction. https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ 5.1 Notebook chunks On the Exam, you will start with an .Rmd (R Markdown) template. The way that this book writes code is in the R Notebook. Learning markdown is useful for other web development and documentation tasks as well. Code is organized into chunks. To run everything in a chunk quickly, press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER. To create a new chunk, use CTRL + ALT + I. 5.2 Basic operations The usual math operations apply. #addition 1 + 2 ## [1] 3 3 - 2 ## [1] 1 #multiplication 2*2 ## [1] 4 #division 4/2 ## [1] 2 #exponentiation 2^3 ## [1] 8 There are two assignment operators: = and &lt;-. The latter is preferred because it is specific to assigning a variable to a value. The “=” operator is also used for assigning values in functions (see the functions section). In R, the shortcut ALT + - creates a &lt;-. #variable assignment x = 2 y &lt;- 2 #equality 4 == 2 #False ## [1] FALSE 5 == 5 #true ## [1] TRUE 3.14 &gt; 3 #true ## [1] TRUE 3.14 &gt;= 3 #true ## [1] TRUE Vectors can be added just like numbers. The c stands for “concatenate”, which creates vectors. x &lt;- c(1,2) y &lt;- c(3,4) x + y ## [1] 4 6 x*y ## [1] 3 8 z &lt;- x + y z^2 ## [1] 16 36 z/2 ## [1] 2 3 z + 3 ## [1] 7 9 Lists are like vectors but can take any type of object type. I already mentioned numeric types. There are also character (string) types, factor types, and boolean types. character &lt;- &quot;The&quot; character_vector &lt;- c(&quot;The&quot;, &quot;Quick&quot;) Factors are characters that expect only specific values. A character can take on any value. A factor is only allowed a finite number of values. This reduces the memory size. The below factor has only one “level”, which is the list of assigned values. factor = as.factor(character) levels(factor) ## [1] &quot;The&quot; The levels of a factor are by default in R in alphabetical order (Q comes alphabetically before T). factor_vector &lt;- as.factor(character_vector) levels(factor_vector) ## [1] &quot;Quick&quot; &quot;The&quot; Booleans are just True and False values. R understands T or TRUE in the same way. When doing math, bools are converted to 0/1 values where 1 is equivalent to TRUE and 0 FALSE. bool_true &lt;- T bool_false &lt;- F bool_true*bool_false ## [1] 0 Vectors work in the same way. bool_vect &lt;- c(T,T, F) sum(bool_vect) ## [1] 2 Vectors are indexed using []. abc &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) abc[1] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; abc[2] ## [1] &quot;b&quot; abc[c(1,3)] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;c&quot; abc[c(1,2)] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; abc[-2] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;c&quot; abc[-c(2,3)] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; 5.3 Lists Lists are vectors that can hold mixed object types. Vectors need to be all of the same type. ls &lt;- list(T, &quot;Character&quot;, 3.14) ls ## [[1]] ## [1] TRUE ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;Character&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 3.14 Lists can be named. ls &lt;- list(bool = T, character = &quot;character&quot;, numeric = 3.14) ls ## $bool ## [1] TRUE ## ## $character ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## $numeric ## [1] 3.14 The $ operator indexes lists. ls$numeric ## [1] 3.14 ls$numeric + 5 ## [1] 8.14 Lists can also be indexed using []. ls[1] ## $bool ## [1] TRUE ls[2] ## $character ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Lists can contain vectors, other lists, and any other object. everything &lt;- list(vector = c(1,2,3), character = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), list = ls) everything ## $vector ## [1] 1 2 3 ## ## $character ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; ## ## $list ## $list$bool ## [1] TRUE ## ## $list$character ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## $list$numeric ## [1] 3.14 To find out the type of an object, use class or str or summary. class(x) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; class(everything) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; str(everything) ## List of 3 ## $ vector : num [1:3] 1 2 3 ## $ character: chr [1:3] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; ## $ list :List of 3 ## ..$ bool : logi TRUE ## ..$ character: chr &quot;character&quot; ## ..$ numeric : num 3.14 summary(everything) ## Length Class Mode ## vector 3 -none- numeric ## character 3 -none- character ## list 3 -none- list 5.4 Functions You only need to understand the very basics of functions for this exam. Still, understanding functions helps you to understand everything in R, since R is a functional programming language, unlike Python, C, VBA, Java which are all object-oriented, or SQL which isn’t really a language but a series of set-operations. Functions do things. The convention is to name a function as a verb. The function make_rainbows() would create a rainbow. The function summarise_vectors would summarise vectors. Functions may or may not have an input and output. If you need to do something in R, there is a high probability that someone has already written a function to do it. That being said, creating simple functions is quite useful. A function that does not return anything greet_me &lt;- function(my_name){ print(paste0(&quot;Hello, &quot;, my_name)) } greet_me(&quot;Future Actuary&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello, Future Actuary&quot; A function that returns something When returning something, the return statement is optional. add_together &lt;- function(x, y){ x + y } add_together(2,5) ## [1] 7 add_together &lt;- function(x, y){ return(x + y) } add_together(2,5) ## [1] 7 Functions can work with vectors. x_vector &lt;- c(1,2,3) y_vector &lt;- c(4,5,6) add_together(x_vector, y_vector) ## [1] 5 7 9 5.5 Data frames R is an old programming language. The original data.frame object has been updated with the newer and better tibble (like the word “table”). Tibbles are really lists of vectors, where each column is a vector. library(tibble) #the tibble library has functions for making tibbles data &lt;- tibble(age = c(25, 35), has_fsa = c(F, T)) data ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## age has_fsa ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 25 FALSE ## 2 35 TRUE To index columns in a tibble, the same “$” is used as indexing a list. data$age ## [1] 25 35 To find the number of rows and columns, use dim. dim(data) ## [1] 2 2 To fine a summary, use summary summary(data) ## age has_fsa ## Min. :25.0 Mode :logical ## 1st Qu.:27.5 FALSE:1 ## Median :30.0 TRUE :1 ## Mean :30.0 ## 3rd Qu.:32.5 ## Max. :35.0 5.6 Pipes The pipe operator %&gt;% is a way of making code more readable and easier to edit. The way that we are taught to do functional composition is by nesting, which is slow to read and write. In five seconds, tell me what the below code is doing. log(sqrt(exp(log2(sqrt((max(c(3, 4, 16)))))))) ## [1] 1 Did you get the answer of 1? If so, you are good at reading parenthesis. This requires starting from the inner-most nested brackets and moving outwards from right to left. The math notation would be slightly easier to read, but still painful. \\[log(\\sqrt{e^{log_2(\\sqrt{max(3,4,16)})}})\\] Here is the same algebra using the pipe. To read this, replace the %&gt;% with the word THEN. library(dplyr) #the pipe is from the dplyr library max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2() %&gt;% exp() %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log() ## [1] 1 #max(c(3, 4, 16) THEN #The max of 3, 4, and 16 is 16 # sqrt() THEN #The square root of 16 is 4 # log2() THEN #The log in base 2 of 4 is 2 # exp() THEN #the exponent of 2 is e^2 # sqrt() THEN #the square root of e^2 is e # log() #the natural logarithm of e is 1 You may not be convinced by this simple example using numbers; however, once we get to data manipulations in the next section the advantage of piping will become obvious. To quickly produce pipes, use CTRL + SHIFT + M. By highlighting only certain sections, we can run the code in steps as if we were using a debugger. This makes testing out code much faster. max(c(3, 4, 16)) ## [1] 16 max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() ## [1] 4 max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2() ## [1] 2 max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2() %&gt;% exp() ## [1] 7.389056 max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2() %&gt;% exp() %&gt;% sqrt() ## [1] 2.718282 max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2() %&gt;% exp() %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log() ## [1] 1 Those familiar with Python’s Pandas will be see that %&gt;% is quite similar to “.”.

In the real exam, you will read the file from the Prometric computer. To read files into R, the readr package has several tools, one for each data format. For instance, the most common format, comma separated values (csv) are read with the read_csv() function. Because the data is already loaded, simply use the below code to access the data. library(ExamPAData) 6.1 Look at the data The data that we are using is health_insurance, which has information on patients and their health care costs. The descriptions of the columns are below. The technical name for this is a “data dictionary”, and one will be provided to you on the real exam. age: Age of the individual sex: Sex bmi: Body Mass Index children: Number of children smoker: Is this person a smoker? region: Region charges: Annual health care costs. head() shows the top n rows. head(20) shows the top 20 rows. library(tidyverse) head(health_insurance) ## # A tibble: 6 x 7 ## age sex bmi children smoker region charges ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 19 female 27.9 0 yes southwest 16885. ## 2 18 male 33.8 1 no southeast 1726. ## 3 28 male 33 3 no southeast 4449. ## 4 33 male 22.7 0 no northwest 21984. ## 5 32 male 28.9 0 no northwest 3867. ## 6 31 female 25.7 0 no southeast 3757. Using a pipe is an alternative way of doing this. Because this is more time-efficient, this will be the preferred method in this manual. health_insurance %&gt;% head() The glimpse function is a transpose of the head() function, which can be more spatially efficient. This also gives you the dimension (1,338 rows, 7 columns). health_insurance %&gt;% glimpse() ## Observations: 1,338 ## Variables: 7 ## $ age &lt;dbl&gt; 19, 18, 28, 33, 32, 31, 46, 37, 37, 60, 25, 62, 23, 5... ## $ sex &lt;chr&gt; &quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;, &quot;... ## $ bmi &lt;dbl&gt; 27.900, 33.770, 33.000, 22.705, 28.880, 25.740, 33.44... ## $ children &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,... ## $ smoker &lt;chr&gt; &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;... ## $ region &lt;chr&gt; &quot;southwest&quot;, &quot;southeast&quot;, &quot;southeast&quot;, &quot;northwest&quot;, &quot;... ## $ charges &lt;dbl&gt; 16884.924, 1725.552, 4449.462, 21984.471, 3866.855, 3... One of the most useful data science tools is counting things. The function count() gives the number of records by a categorical feature. health_insurance %&gt;% count(children) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## children n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 574 ## 2 1 324 ## 3 2 240 ## 4 3 157 ## 5 4 25 ## 6 5 18 Two categories can be counted at once. This creates a table with all combinations of cut and color and shows the number of records in each category. health_insurance %&gt;% count(region, sex) ## # A tibble: 8 x 3 ## region sex n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 northeast female 161 ## 2 northeast male 163 ## 3 northwest female 164 ## 4 northwest male 161 ## 5 southeast female 175 ## 6 southeast male 189 ## 7 southwest female 162 ## 8 southwest male 163 The summary() function is shows a statistical summary. One caveat is that each column needs to be in it’s appropriate type. For example, smoker, region, and sex are all listed as characters when if they were factors, summary would give you count info. With incorrect data types health_insurance %&gt;% summary() ## age sex bmi children ## Min. :18.00 Length:1338 Min. :15.96 Min. :0.000 ## 1st Qu.:27.00 Class :character 1st Qu.:26.30 1st Qu.:0.000 ## Median :39.00 Mode :character Median :30.40 Median :1.000 ## Mean :39.21 Mean :30.66 Mean :1.095 ## 3rd Qu.:51.00 3rd Qu.:34.69 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :64.00 Max. :53.13 Max. :5.000 ## smoker region charges ## Length:1338 Length:1338 Min. : 1122 ## Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.: 4740 ## Mode :character Mode :character Median : 9382 ## Mean :13270 ## 3rd Qu.:16640 ## Max. :63770 With correct data types This tells you that there are 324 patients in the northeast, 325 in the northwest, 364 in the southeast, and so fourth. health_insurance &lt;- health_insurance %&gt;% modify_if(is.character, as.factor) health_insurance %&gt;% summary() ## age sex bmi children smoker ## Min. :18.00 female:662 Min. :15.96 Min. :0.000 no :1064 ## 1st Qu.:27.00 male :676 1st Qu.:26.30 1st Qu.:0.000 yes: 274 ## Median :39.00 Median :30.40 Median :1.000 ## Mean :39.21 Mean :30.66 Mean :1.095 ## 3rd Qu.:51.00 3rd Qu.:34.69 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :64.00 Max. :53.13 Max. :5.000 ## region charges ## northeast:324 Min. : 1122 ## northwest:325 1st Qu.: 4740 ## southeast:364 Median : 9382 ## southwest:325 Mean :13270 ## 3rd Qu.:16640 ## Max. :63770 6.2 Transform the data Transforming, manipulating, querying, and wrangling are all words for the task of changing the values in a data frame. For those Excel users out there, this can be interpreted as “what Pivot tables, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, and SUMIFF do”. R syntax is designed to be similar to SQL. They begin with a SELECT, use GROUP BY to aggregate, and have a WHERE to remove records. Unlike SQL, the ordering of these does not matter. SELECT can come after a WHERE. R to SQL translation select() -&gt; SELECT mutate() -&gt; user-defined columns summarize() -&gt; aggregated columns left_join() -&gt; LEFT JOIN filter() -&gt; WHERE group_by() -&gt; GROUP BY filter() -&gt; HAVING arrange() -&gt; ORDER BY health_insurance %&gt;% select(age, region) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## age region ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 19 southwest ## 2 18 southeast ## 3 28 southeast ## 4 33 northwest ## 5 32 northwest ## 6 31 southeast Tip: use CTRL + SHIFT + M to create pipes %&gt;%. Let’s look at only those in the southeast region. Instead of WHERE, use filter. health_insurance %&gt;% filter(region == &quot;southeast&quot;) %&gt;% select(age, region) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## age region ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 18 southeast ## 2 28 southeast ## 3 31 southeast ## 4 46 southeast ## 5 62 southeast ## 6 56 southeast The SQL translation is SELECT age, region FROM health_insurance WHERE region = &#39;southeast&#39; Instead of ORDER BY, use arrange.

["visualization.html", "Chapter 7 Visualization 7.1 Step 1. Put the data in a pivotable format 7.2 Step 2. Create a plot object (ggplot) 7.3 Step 3: Add a plot", " Chapter 7 Visualization The creator’s of the exam do not expect candidates to be expert data scientists. Being able to create basic one-dimensional graphs and to interpret results is most important. Creating graphs in R is easy. The most popular way to do this is with the ggplot library. Three-Steps: 7.1 Step 1. Put the data in a pivotable format Excel users will know this as “pivot-table format”, or the way that a table is organized so it can be put into a pivot table. This is also known as “tidy format”. There is one-row per record and one column per variable. 7.1.1 Example of “wide” or “matrix” format The data below contains counts on a survey which asked people about their religion and annual income. religion is stored in the rows income is spread across the columns This is difficult to work with because there are a lot of columns. ## # A tibble: 6 x 11 ## religion `&lt;$10k` `$10-20k` `$20-30k` `$30-40k` `$40-50k` `$50-75k` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Agnostic 27 34 60 81 76 137 ## 2 Atheist 12 27 37 52 35 70 ## 3 Buddhist 27 21 30 34 33 58 ## 4 Catholic 418 617 732 670 638 1116 ## 5 Don’t k~ 15 14 15 11 10 35 ## 6 Evangel~ 575 869 1064 982 881 1486 ## # ... with 4 more variables: `$75-100k` &lt;dbl&gt;, `$100-150k` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `&gt;150k` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Don&#39;t know/refused` &lt;dbl&gt; 7.1.2 Example of “pivotable”, “long”, or “tidy” format Here is the same data only in a long format. You don’t need to know how to switch between the two for now, but only that the long format is what is needed to create graphs. 7.2 Step 2. Create a plot object (ggplot) The first step is to create a blank canvas that holds the columns that are needed. Let’s say that the goal is to graph income and count. We put these into a ggplot object called p. The aesthetic argument, aes, means that the x-axis will have income and the y-axis will have count. p &lt;- data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = income, y = count)) If we look at p, we see that it is nothing but white space with axis for count and income. p 7.3 Step 3: Add a plot We add an xy plot. p + geom_point() We can also create a bar plot. p + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) Creating histograms is even easier. Just specify the column that you want to graph as the x column. No y is needed because a histogram is one-dimensional. Take a x to be a random variable from a gamma distribution. gamma = tibble(x = rgamma(1000, shape = 1, rate = 2)) p &lt;- gamma %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = x)) p + geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. We can graph a density instead of a histogram by using geom_density instead of geom_hist. p + geom_density(fill = &quot;grey&quot;) "],
["tree-based-models.html", "Chapter 8 Tree-based models 8.1 Decision Trees 8.2 Advantages and disadvantages 8.3 Random Forests 8.4 Gradient Boosted Trees", " Chapter 8 Tree-based models 8.1 Decision Trees Decision trees can be used for either classification or regression problems. The model structure is a series of yes/no questions. Depending on how each observation answers these questions, a prediction is made. The below example shows how a single tree can predict health claims. For non-smokers, the predicted annual claims are 8,434. This represents 80% of the observations For smokers with a bmi of less than 30, the predicted annual claims are 21,000. 10% of patients fall into this bucket. For smokers with a bmi of more than 30, the prediction is 42,000. This bucket accounts for 11% of patients. Figure 8.1: Decision tree of health costs We can cut the data set up into these groups and look at the claim costs. From this grouping, we can see that smoker is the most important variable as the difference in average claims is about 20,000. smoker bmi_30 mean_claims percent no bmi &lt; 30 $7,977.03 0.38 no bmi &gt;= 30 $8,842.69 0.42 yes bmi &lt; 30 $21,363.22 0.10 yes bmi &gt;= 30 $41,557.99 0.11 This was a very simple example because there were only two variables. If we have more variables, the tree will get large very quickly. This will result in overfitting; there will be good performance on the training data but poor performance on the test data. The step-by-step process of building a tree is Step 1: Choose a variable at random. This could be any variable in age, children, charges, sex, smoker, age_bucket, bmi, or region. Step 2: Find the split point which best seperates observations out based on the value of \\(y\\). A good split is one where the \\(y\\)’s are very different. * In this case, smoker was chosen. Then we can only split this in one way: smoker = 1 or smoker = 0. Then for each of these groups, smokers and non-smokers, choose another variable at random. In this case, for no-smokers, age was chosen. To find the best cut point of age, look at all possible age cut points from 18, 19, 20, 21, …, 64 and choose the one which best separates the data. There are three ways of deciding where to split Entropy (aka, information gain) Gini Classification error Of these, only the first two are commonly used. The exam is not going to ask you to calculate either of these. Just know that neither method will work better on all data sets, and so the best practice is to test both and compare the performance. Step 3: Continue doing this until a stopping criteria is reached. For example, the minimum number of observations is 5 or less. As you can see, this results in a very deep tree. tree &lt;- rpart(formula = charges ~ ., data = health_insurance, control = rpart.control(cp = 0.003)) rpart.plot(tree, type = 3) Step 4: Apply cost comlexity pruning to simplify the tree Intuitively, we know that the above model would perform poorly due to overfitting. We want to make it simpler by removing nodes. This is very similar to how in linear models we reduce complexity by reducing the number of coefficients. A measure of the depth of the tree is the complexity. You can think of \\(|T|\\) as the “degrees of freedom” in a linear model. In the above example, \\(|T| = 8\\). The amount of penalization is controlled by \\(\\alpha\\). This is very similar to \\(\\lambda\\) in the Lasso. To calculate the cost of a tree, number the terminal nodes from \\(1\\) to \\(|T|\\), and let the set of observations that fall into the \\(mth\\) bucket be \\(R_m\\). Then add up the squared error over all terminal nodes to the penalty term. \\[ \\text{Cost}_\\alpha(T) = \\sum_{m=1}^{|T|} \\sum_{R_m}(y_i - \\hat{y}_{Rm})^2 + \\alpha |T| \\] Step 5: Use cross-validation to select the best alpha The cost is controlled by the CP parameter. In the above example, did you notice the line rpart.control(cp = 0.003)? This is telling rpart to continue growing the tree until the CP reaches 0.003. At each subtree, we can measure the cost CP as well as the cross-validation error xerror. This is stored in the cptable library(kableExtra) library(tidyverse) tree &lt;- rpart(formula = charges ~ ., data = health_insurance, control = rpart.control(cp = 0.0001)) cost &lt;- tree$cptable %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% select(nsplit, CP, xerror) cost %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## nsplit CP xerror ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 0.620 1.00 ## 2 1 0.144 0.381 ## 3 2 0.0637 0.240 ## 4 3 0.00967 0.180 ## 5 4 0.00784 0.174 ## 6 5 0.00712 0.171 As more splits are added, the cost continues to decrease, reaches a minimum, and then begins to increase. To optimize performance, choose the number of splits which has the lowest error. Often, though, the goal of using a decision tree is to create a simple model. In this case, we can err or the side of a lower nsplit so that the tree is shorter and more interpretable. All of the questions on so far have only used decision trees for interpretability, and a different model method has been used when predictive power is needed. You will typically be given the below code, which does this automatically. To get full credit on decision tree questions, mention that you used cross-validation to select the number of splits. pruned_tree &lt;- prune(tree,cp = tree$cptable[which.min(tree$cptable[, &quot;xerror&quot;]), &quot;CP&quot;]) 8.2 Advantages and disadvantages Advantages Easy to interpret Captures interaction effects Captures non-linearities Handles continuous and categorical data Handles missing values Disadvantages Is a “weak learner” because of low predictive power Does not work on small data sets Is often a simplification of the underlying process because all observations at terminal nodes have equal predicted values Is biased towards selecting high-cardinality features because more possible split points for these features tend to lead to overfitting High variance (which can be alleviated with stricter parameters) leads the “easy to interpret results” to change upon retraining Unable to predict beyond the range of the training data for regression (because each predicted value is an average of training samples) Readings ISLR 8.1.1 Basics of Decision Trees ISLR 8.1.2 Classification Trees rpart Documentation (Optional) 8.3 Random Forests Advantages Resilient to overfitting due to bagging Only one parameter to tune (mtry, the number of features considered at each split) Very good a multi-class prediction Nonlinearities Interaction effects Deal with unbalanced and missing data*Usually requires over/undersamplin Disadvantages Does not work on small data sets Weaker performance than other methods (GBM, NN) Unable to predict beyond training data for regression Readings ISLR 8.1.1 Basics of Decision Trees ISLR 8.1.2 Classification Trees 8.4 Gradient Boosted Trees High prediction accuracy Closest model to a “silver bullet” that exists Nonlinearities, interaction effects, resilient to outliers, corrects for missing values Deals with class imbalance directly through by weighting observations Disadvantages Requires large sample size Longer training time Does not detect linear combinations of features.
