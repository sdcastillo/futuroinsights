## Installing R

To begin, you will need to install R. This is the engine that runs the code. You need to install the newest version **(v4)** as well as an older version **(v3.6.2)**. 

The older version will be used when running the code from the modules of SOA, which needs to be consistent with what will be installed on the Prometric computers. This course uses the newest version so that you will not have as many errors during practice.

Download it from here: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

You can easily switch between both of them after installation.

```{r echo = F, fig.align="center", warning=F, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rversion1.png")
```


```{r echo = F, fig.align="center", warning=F, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rversion2.png")
```

Remember: 

For this course, use a version later than 4.0.2.

For the module of SOA, use version 3.6.2.

## Installing RStudio

Just as MS Word creates documents, RStudio creates R scripts and other documents. This is the tool that helps you to *write* the code. Download the free edition of RStudio Desktop and instal it at your selected location.

Download it from here: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Next you need to set the R library. R code is organized into libraries. You want to use the same code that will be on the Prometric Computers. It would require installing older versions of libraries. Change your R library to the one which was included within the Modules of SOA.

```{r eval = F}
.libPaths("PATH_TO_SOAS_LIBRARY/PAlibrary")
```

## Download the data

For your convenience, all data in this book, including data from prior exams and sample solutions, has been put into a library called `ExamPAData` which is available on CRAN.

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("ExamPAData")
library(ExamPAData)
```

To get the data dictionary for a data set, use `?dataset_name` such as `?customer_phone_calls`. For your convenience, you can use these data sets for your practice. They make great candidates for machine learning problems.
